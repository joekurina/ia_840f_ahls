# OFS Agilex 7 PCIe Attach FPGA Development Directory

This is the OFS Agilex 7 PCIe Attach FPGA development top-level directory. This repository supports targeting the same design to multiple board configurations specified in **syn/board/<board_name>** folder.

The configurations described here are included as examples in the reference release. Users may construct their own .ofss settings files. For example, the number of PFs or VFs could be changed in any PCIe configuration.

OFSS settings control PCIe configuration, primary clock frequency, local memory and Ethernet topology.

Work directory names in the commands below are merely examples and may be changed.

## Board
* n6001 
   - Default .ip parameters are based on n6001 design
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p n6001 work_n6001
    ```
   - Additionally, the n6001 FIM supports reconfiguring the IP via .ofss flow. For
     example, to change the HSSI configuration pass the .ofss files below: 
    ```bash
        # n6001 with 2x100G 
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_2x100.ofss n6001 work_n6001_2x100

        # n6001 with 8x10G 
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_8x10.ofss n6001 work_n6001_8x10
    ```
   - Multiple IP changes can be combined. This selects a 470 MHz clock and 8x10G Ethernet:
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/iopll/iopll_470MHz.ofss,tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_8x10.ofss n6001 work_dir
    ```

* fseries-dk
   - The default fseries-dk configuration includes Ethernet 8x25G:
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p fseries-dk work_fseries-dk
    ```
  
* n6000
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p n6000 work_n6000
    ```

* iseries-dk
   - The default iseries-dk sets PCIe to Gen5x16 and Ethernet to 8x25G. The PCIe data bus width is 1024 bits:
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p iseries-dk work_iseries-dk
    ```

   - PCIe may also be configured with 2 independent links, each with 512 bit data buses:
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host_2link.ofss iseries-dk work_iseries-dk
    ```

    - For lower host bandwidth applications, selecting PCIe Gen4x16 will save area by instantiating a 512 bit PCIe data bus:
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host_gen4.ofss iseries-dk work_iseries-dk-1link
    ```

   - Multiple IP configurations may be specified, for example 2 PCIe links and Ethernet 200G:
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host_2link.ofss,tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_2x200_ftile.ofss iseries-dk work_iseries-dk_200
    ```

   - Ethernet 400G:
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/hssi/hssi_1x400_ftile.ofss iseries-dk work_iseries-dk_400
    ```

   - Slim FIM with 2 PCIe Gen5x8 links, each with 1PF and 1VF, no HSSI:
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/pcie/pcie_host_2link_1pf_1vf.ofss iseries-dk:no_hssi,pr_floorplan=syn/board/iseries-dk/setup/pr_assignments_slim.tcl work_iseries-dk_slim
    ```
   
    - Emif configured to use RDIMM (Memory that ships with the devkit):
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh -p --ofss tools/ofss_config/memory/memory_rtile_8g_rdimm.ofss iseries-dk:emif_rdimm_pin_assn work_iseries-dk
    ```

* mseries-dk
   - Compiling the mseries-dk design requires .ofss for changing the .ip configuration. Uses NOC & HBM and works only in flat compile
    ```bash
        ./ofs-common/scripts/common/syn/build_top.sh --ofss tools/ofss_config/mseries-dk.ofss mseries-dk:flat work_mseries-dk
    ```
