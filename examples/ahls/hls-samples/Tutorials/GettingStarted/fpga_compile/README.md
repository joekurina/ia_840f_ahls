## Purpose

Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are configurable integrated circuits that can be programmed to implement arbitrary circuit topologies. Classified as *spatial* compute architectures, FPGAs differ significantly from fixed Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) devices like CPUs and GPUs. FPGAs offer a different set of optimization trade-offs from these traditional accelerator devices.

While SYCL* code can be compiled for CPU, GPU, or FPGA, compiling to FPGA is somewhat different. This tutorial explains these differences and shows how to compile a "Hello World" style vector addition kernel for FPGA, following the recommended workflow.

## Key Implementation Details

### FPGA Compilation Differences

FPGAs differ from CPUs and GPUs in many interesting ways.

Compared to CPU or GPU, generating a device image for FPGA hardware is a computationally intensive and time-consuming process. It is usual for an FPGA compile to take several hours to complete. For this reason, only ahead-of-time (or "offline") kernel compilation mode is supported for FPGA. The long compile time for FPGA hardware makes just-in-time (or "online") compilation impractical.

Long compile times are detrimental to developer productivity. The HLS IP Gen Compiler provides several mechanisms that enable developers targeting FPGAs to iterate quickly on their designs. By circumventing the time-consuming process of full FPGA compilation wherever possible, developers can enjoy the fast compile times familiar to CPU and GPU developers.

### Generating and Testing an IP Component

In the FPGA IP component generation flow, you can generate an IP component that you can import into an Quartus® Prime project. You can generate an IP by targeting your compilation to a supported FPGA device family or part number (for example, `Agilex 7` or `AGFA014R24B1E1V`).

The FPGA IP component generation flow does not generate any FPGA accelerated executable, only RTL (Register Transfer Level) IP component files. The host application is treated only as a test bench that exercises and validates your IP component in emulation and simulation.

### Four Compilation Options

The four types of FPGA compilation are summarized in the table below.

| Target              | Expected Time  | Output              | Description
|:---                 |:---            |:---                 |:---
| Emulator            | Seconds        | x86-64 binary       | Compiles the FPGA device code to the CPU. Use the Altera® FPGA Emulation Platform for OpenCL™ software to verify your SYCL code’s functional correctness.
| Optimization Report | Minutes        | RTL + FPGA reports  | Compiles the FPGA device code to RTL and generates an optimization report that describes the structures generated on the FPGA, identifies performance bottlenecks, and estimates resource utilization.
| Simulator          | Minutes         | RTL + FPGA reports + x86-64 binary    | Compiles the FPGA device code to RTL and generates a simulation test bench. Use the Questa*-Altera® FPGA Edition simulator to verify your design.
| FPGA Hardware      | Multiple Hours  | Quartus Place & Route + FPGA reports                                                  | Compiles the FPGA device code to RTL and compiles the generated RTL using Quartus® Prime.

The typical FPGA development workflow is to iterate in each of these stages, refining the code using the feedback provided by that stage. You can avoid long compile times by relying on emulation and the optimization report whenever possible.

#### Emulator

The FPGA emulator is the fastest method to verify the correctness of your code. The FPGA emulator executes the SYCL* device code on the CPU. The emulator is similar to the SYCL* host device, but unlike the host device, the FPGA emulator device supports FPGA extensions such as FPGA pipes and `fpga_reg` (although some of these features, such as `fpga_reg` may not affect how your design runs on the emulator).

There are two important caveats to remember when using the FPGA emulator.

- **Performance is not representative.** Never draw inferences about FPGA performance from the FPGA emulator. The FPGA emulator's timing behavior is uncorrelated to that of the physical FPGA hardware. For example, an optimization that yields a 100x performance improvement on the FPGA may show no impact on the emulator performance. It may show an unrelated increase or even a decrease.
- **Undefined behavior may differ.** If your code produces different results when compiled for the FPGA emulator versus FPGA hardware, your code may demonstrate undefined behavior. By definition, undefined behavior is not specified by the language specification and may manifest differently on different targets.

#### Optimization Report (Early Image)

For this compilation type, your SYCL device code is optimized and converted into an FPGA design specified in Verilog RTL (a low-level, native entry language for FPGAs). This intermediate compilation result is also called the *FPGA early device image*, which is **not** executable.

The optimization report contains significant information about how the compiler has transformed your device code into an FPGA design. The report includes visualizations of structures generated on the FPGA, performance and expected performance bottleneck information, and estimated resource utilization. Optimization reports are generated for the "optimization report", "simulator" and "hardware" compilation types.

The Altera® HLS IP Gen Handbook contains a chapter on [analysing your design](https://docs.altera.com/r/docs/m615048/current/hls-ip-gen-handbook/8-analyzing-your-design) with the optimization report.

#### Simulator

The FPGA simulator allows you to simulate the exact behavior of the synthesized kernel. Like emulation, you can run simulation on a system that does not have a target FPGA board installed. The simulator models a kernel much more accurately than the emulator, but it is much slower than the emulator.

The HLS IP Gen Compiler links your design C++ test bench with an RTL-compiled version of your component that runs in an RTL simulator. You do not need to invoke any RTL simulator manually, but you can add the `-Xsghdl` flag to save the simulation waveform for later viewing.

> **Note**: Running the simulation executable can take a long time if your device code is complex or if your test inputs are large. To save simulation time, use the smallest possible input.

#### FPGA Hardware (Hardware Image)

The generated Verilog RTL is mapped onto the FPGA hardware resources by the Quartus® Prime software. The estimated performance and resource utilization is therefore much more accurate than the estimates obtained in the optimization report compilation type.

Note that the compilation result is **not** executable. IP components are compiled in isolation and not interfaced with other components on the FPGA. The purpose of this compilation flow is to get accurate resource utilization and performance data for IP components.

This compilation process can take hours.

### Device Selectors

The following code snippet demonstrates how you can specify the target device in your source code. The selector is used to specify the target device at runtime.

It is recommended to use a preprocessor macro to choose between the emulator and FPGA selectors. This makes it easy to switch between targets using only command-line options. Since the FPGA only supports ahead-of-time compilation, dynamic selectors (such as the `default_selector`) are less useful than explicit selectors when targeting FPGA.

```c++
// FPGA device selectors are defined in this utility header
#include <sycl/ext/altera/fpga_extensions.hpp>

int main() {
// choose a selector based on compiler flags.
#if FPGA_SIMULATOR
        auto selector = sycl::ext::altera::fpga_simulator_selector_v;
#elif FPGA_HARDWARE
        auto selector = sycl::ext::altera::fpga_selector_v;
#else  // #if FPGA_EMULATOR
        auto selector = sycl::ext::altera::fpga_emulator_selector_v;
#endif
        sycl::queue q(selector);
    ...
}
```

### Compiler Options

This section includes a helpful list of commands and options to compile this design for the FPGA emulator, generate the FPGA early image optimization reports, and compile for FPGA hardware.

>**Note**: In this sample, the compiler is referred to as `ahls`.

The Altera® HLS IP Gen Handbook has a chapter on [FPGA flows](https://docs.altera.com/r/docs/m615048/current/hls-ip-gen-handbook/4-altera-hls-ip-gen-fpga-development) that explains the compiler options used in these examples.

#### Emulator

```
# FPGA emulator image
ahls -DFPGA_EMULATOR -I../../../../include vector_add.cpp -o vector_add.fpga_emu
```

#### Optimization Report

```
# FPGA early image (with optimization report):
ahls -DFPGA_HARDWARE -I../../../../include vector_add.cpp -Xshardware -fsycl-link=early -Xstarget=Agilex7 -o vector_add_report.a
```
Use the`-Xstarget` flag to target a device family, or a specific FPGA part number.

#### Simulator

```
# FPGA simulator image:
ahls -DFPGA_SIMULATOR -I../../../../include vector_add.cpp -Xssimulation -Xstarget=Agilex7 -Xsghdl -o vector_add_sim.fpga_sim
```
Through `-Xstarget`, you can target a device family, or an FPGA part number.

#### FPGA Hardware

```
# FPGA hardware image:
ahls -DFPGA_HARDWARE -I../../../../include vector_add.cpp -Xshardware -Xstarget=Agilex7 -o vector_add.fpga
```
Through `-Xstarget`, you can target a device family, or an FPGA part number.

`-DFPGA_EMULATOR`, `-DFPGA_SIMULATOR`, `-DFPGA_HARDWARE` are options that add a preprocessor define that invokes the emulator/simulator/FPGA device selector in this sample (see code snippet above).

### Source Code Description

There are 4 parts to this tutorial located in the 3 sub-folders. Together, they demonstrate how you can migrate an algorithm from vanilla C++ code to SYCL for FPGA. Note that you may also choose to use a functor with buffers, or a function with USM.


#### Part 1: C++

Part 1 demonstrates a vector addition program in vanilla C++. Observe how the `VectorAdd` function is separated from the `main()` function, and the `vec_a`, `vec_b`, and `vec_c` vectors are allocated onto the heap.

#### Part 2: SYCL* (functor and USM)

Part 2 shows the same vector addition from part 1, but in SYCL* C++ with a 'functor' coding style using a unified shared memory (USM) interface. Compare with the source code in part 1 to see SYCL*-specific code changes. Observe how the `VectorAdd` functor is called using `q.single_task<...>(VectorAdd{...});`. This tells the DPC++ compiler to convert `VectorAdd` into RTL. Also observe how `vec_a`, `vec_b`, and `vec_c` are allocated into a shared memory space using `malloc_shared`; this tells the DPC++ compiler that `vec_a`, `vec_b`, and `vec_c` should be visible both to your kernel and your host code (or if you are creating an IP component, the test bench code).

#### Part 3: SYCL* (lambda function and USM)

Part 3 demonstrates vector addition in SYCL* C++ with a 'function' coding style using unified shared memory (USM). This code style will be familiar to users who are already experienced with SYCL*. Observe how the `VectorAdd` function is called using a lambda expression:
```c++
h.single_task<...>([=]() {
    VectorAdd(...);
});
```
#### Part 4: SYCL* (lambda function and buffer)

Part 4 shows the vector addition in SYCL* C++ with a 'function' coding style and buffer & accessor interface. This code style will be familiar to users who are already experienced with SYCL*. Observe how `vec_a`, `vec_b`, and `vec_c` are copied into buffers before the `VectorAdd` function is called.

## Build the `FPGA Compile` Tutorial

>**Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the HLS IP Gen Compiler using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `fpgavars` script in the root of your HLS IP Gen Compiler installation every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - `source <install-dir>/fpgavars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/fpgavars.sh ; exec csh'`


### Generate the Makefiles for the Parts

#### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.

2. Build the program for Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DPART=<X>
   ```
   where `-DPART=<X>` is:
   - `-DPART=1`: Compile `part1_cpp`
   - `-DPART=2`: Compile `part2_dpcpp_functor_usm`
   - `-DPART=3`: Compile `part3_dpcpp_lambda_usm`
   - `-DPART=4`: Compile `part4_dpcpp_lambda_buffers`
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the following command. **Targeting a BSP is not supported.**
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number> -DPART=<X>

### Build the Parts

After using CMake to generate build artifacts, you can build specific targets. This project can build 4 targets.

The `fpga_emu` and `fpga_sim` targets produce binaries that you can run. The executables will be called `vector_add.fpga_emu`, and `vector_add.fpga_sim`.

For part 1 of this tutorial, only the `fpga_emu` target is available as this regular C++ code only  target a CPU.

#### On Linux

1. Compile the design using `make`.

   | Compilation Type    | Command
   |:---                 |:---
   | FPGA Emulator       | `make fpga_emu`
   | Optimization Report | `make report`
   | FPGA Simulator      | `make fpga_sim`
   | FPGA Hardware       | `make fpga`

### Read the Reports

In *part2*, *part3* and *part4*, after running the `report` target, the FPGA optimization report can be viewed using the HLS IP Gen FPGA Report Main Menu:

1. Open the Altera® HLS IP Gen Report Main Menu (\<HLS IP Gen installation directory>/share/lib/reports/html_report/report.html) in a supported browser*. If you cannot find the HLS IP Gen Report Main Menu path, try running 'fpga_report'.
```
<browser of choice> <HLS IP Gen Compiler installation directory>/share/lib/reports/html_report/report.html
```
![The HLS IP Gen FPGA Report Main Menu, which includes a recently opened section and a getting started section with import file buttons.](assets/report_main_menu.png)

2. Import your design's reporting data .zip file (vector_add.report.prj/reports/vector_add_report.zip)

![The summary page of the optimization report generated by running the report target for part 2.](assets/part2_report_example.png)

Browse the reports that were generated for the `VectorAdd` kernel's FPGA early image. You may also want to examine the reports generated by the simulation compile and full FPGA hardware compile and compare their contents.
